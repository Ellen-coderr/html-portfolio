<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone my name is Ellen Hovsepyan and I am 15 years old. I live in Armenia contry Yerevan, and i really enjoy
  living in here. I go to Armenian-Chinese friendship school. I really love my school because i study there except the 
  classes those are in other schools, and i study chinese. I really enjoy studing languages and many other things
  those are new for me. Except that i study many new things in my school, i have new friends from there. I have
   met my First, real best friend and have met other new, good friends. I realy love my school and also my country.
</p>

<p>I have many hobbies right now. The best hobbie of mine is coding. I have started to code one month ago, and i really
  enjoy it. Sometimes it seems difficult but still i study it everyday. It kind of motivate me to reach my goal. My goal
  is to start working at the age of 16 or even 15 by coding or creating websites etc. Udemy program is really helpful in 
  my opinion, because of that program i have learnt many new things which ones i thought i will never understand.
  And i guess i will reach my goal.

<p>About my carrer my plan is to study abroud for university. I have two options. First one is to go to China by passing HSK5
  exam. Btw right now im working on that by learning hsk3. I really love the chinese language, it seems so difficult for everyone 
  but if you study from the begining really good it will be so easy in the future. The second option is to go to Europe by passing 
  toefl. Toefl is an English exam. It is kind of difficult but i know for 100% that i will pass it really good. So we will see it 
  in one or wo years. Thank you for reading this, see you!
